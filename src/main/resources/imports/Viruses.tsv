virusName|description
Zika Virus|"the most common symptoms of Zika virus infection are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis; a link to neurological syndromes, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, and birth defects is strongly suspected."
Coronavirus|any of a family (Coronaviridae) of single-stranded RNA viruses that have a lipid envelope studded with club-shaped projections, infect birds and many mammals including humans, and include the causative agents of MERS, SARS, and COVID-19
Paramyxovirus| One of a group of RNA viruses that are predominantly responsible for acute respiratory diseases and are usually transmitted by airborne droplets. The paramyxoviruses include the agents of mumps, measles (rubeola), RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), Newcastle disease, and parainfluenza.
Flavivirus|A family of viruses transmitted by mosquitos and ticks that cause some important diseases, including dengue, yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and West Nile fever. The flaviviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses containing three structural proteins and a host-derived lipid bilayer.
Calicivirus|The Caliciviridae are a family of viruses, members of Class IV of the Baltimore scheme. They are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA which is not segmented. Thirteen species are placed in this family, divided among eleven genera.
Hepevirus|The Hepeviridae includes enterically-transmitted, small, non-enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses. Members of the family are assigned to two genera and five species. Members of the Piscihepevirus genus infect trout and members of the Orthohepevirus genus infect mammals and birds.
Pneumovirus|The Pneumoviridae is a family of large enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses. This taxon formerly was a subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae, but was reclassified as a family in 2016. Members of genus Orthopneumovirus infect mammals while members of Metapneumovirus are specific for mammals or birds.
Reovirus|Reoviridae is a family of viruses. They have a wide host range, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, protists and fungi. They lack lipid envelopes and package their genomes of discrete double-stranded segments of RNA within multi-layered capsids.
